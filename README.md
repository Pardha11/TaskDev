## Inspiration
TaskDev was inspired by the need for a dedicated space where programmers and clients can connect meaningfully. Unlike generic gig platforms, TaskDev focuses on the unique needs of coders and the clients seeking their expertise. It bridges the gap by allowing clients to clearly outline programming tasks — specifying languages, frameworks, and goals — while enabling developers to choose projects that align with their skills. Prioritizing clear communication, transparent pricing, and thorough feedback, TaskDev fosters a collaborative community where both sides build lasting relationships and grow together.

## What it does
TaskDev is a platform that serves to enhance communication between clients and coders:
* Empowers clients to post programming tasks with detailed descriptions
* Allows clients to set fair prices and specify required technologies
* Enables developers to browse tasks and select projects matching their expertise
* Facilitates direct negotiation of terms between clients and developers
* Implements a rating system for clients after task completion, ensuring accountability
* Streamlines the process of finding and offering programming work

## How we built it
TaskDev was created using a combination of various languages and frameworks to create an intuitive and efficient final product: 
* Full Stack Development with Ruby on Rails: For both our frontend and backend, we used Ruby on Rails and took advantage of its solid full-stack framework and ease of use to form a robust app foundation[.
